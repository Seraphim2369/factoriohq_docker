- Upload and manage save files
- View server and game logs in real-time
- Manage server mods
- Uses the [factoriotools](https://hub.docker.com/r/factoriotools/factorio/) Docker image to run game servers

## Requirements

- Ruby 3.2.4
- Rails 8.0.2
- Docker

## Installation

⚠️ WARNING ⚠️ Server must run as 845:845 to match factoriotools docker image file permissions

## Development

### Background Jobs

FactorioHQ uses background jobs for server operations and log streaming:

- `ServerOperationJob`: Handles starting and stopping servers
- `StreamGameLogsJob`: Captures and stores game logs
- `ServerStatusSyncJob`: Runs when web server starts to sync server status with actual Docker container status
